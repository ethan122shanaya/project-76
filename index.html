        <h3>A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing—no particles or even electromagnetic radiation 
            such as light—can escape from it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime
             to form a black hole. </h3>

             <h2> who discovered blackholes </h2>

             <h3>British astronomers Louise Webster and Paul Murdin at the Royal Greenwich Observatory and Thomas Bolton,
                  a student at the University of Toronto, independently announced the discovery of a massive but invisible object in orbit
                   around a blue star over 6,000 light-years away.</h3>
